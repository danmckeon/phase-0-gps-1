# GPS 1 Reflection
## Dan McKeon

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Managing the pushing and pulling from remote repos was my biggest struggle.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

My GPS Guide, Laura, really helped me understand the pushing and pulling concepts I was struggling with - how often to merge, how often to be pushing and pulling, and understanding how branches are reflected on my local machine.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked primarily about the questions directly above. I also asked how often I should be committing. She noted it's not good to be committing too often, but also not to infrequently, so it kind of depends on the org. In general though, it's whenever a discrete major step is completed.

What still confuses you about Git?

I'm pretty clear, but the things I struggle most with are definitely related to remote repos

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I didn't have a pair, but my GPS Guide was extremely helpful. Great experience.
